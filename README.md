<h1 align="center">🚩 Problem Statement</h1>

Security teams face alert fatigue due to thousands of daily alerts.  
This leads to missed critical threats and delayed incident response.

Our project aims to:  
✅ _Detect_ threats in real-time using AI/ML  
✅ _Prioritize_ threats with risk scoring  
✅ _Visualize_ attacks on a global map  
✅ _Explain_ why each alert was classified as a threat

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 _AI-Driven Anomaly Detection_ – Trained on CICIDS 2017 dataset
- 📊 _Statistical IP Analysis_ – Track frequency of malicious IPs, destination ports, etc.
- 🌍 _Global Attack Visualization_ – Map attacker IPs on a world map with red markers
- 🏷 _Threat Prioritization & Explanation_ – Risk score, type and reason
- 🛢 _MongoDB Backend_ – Stores predictions in structured JSON format
- 🖥 _Interactive Dashboard_ – Clean UI to view, filter, and analyze threats

<h2>📊 Screenshots & Visualizations</h2>
Below are some key screenshots of our ML model training and prediction workflow:<Br><br>

🧠 Model Training – Trained on the CICIDS 2017 dataset to classify network traffic as Normal or Malicious.<br>

🔎 Primary Prediction – First model classifies incoming logs in real time.<br>

🤖 Secondary Analysis (Gemini Model) – If malicious, a secondary ML model classifies the exact attack type (e.g., DDoS, PortScan).<Br>

🛢 Data Storage – Predictions (both normal & malicious) are pushed into MongoDB for dashboard visualization.<br>

🌍 Visualization – Dashboard maps attackers, shows risk scores, and allows filtering for SOC analysis.<br><br>

<h2>🛠 Tech Stack</h2>

Frontend: React.js, Chart.js

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database: MongoDB

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy,

Dataset: CICIDS 2017 (Combined & Preprocessed)

<h2>⚡ Installation & Setup</h2>

# 1️⃣ Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/devansh436/threat-detection.git<Br>
cd threat-detection

# 2️⃣ Install backend dependencies

cd server<br>
npm install

# 3️⃣ Start the backend server

npm run dev

# 4️⃣ Start the frontend (if React)

cd client<br>
npm install<br>
npm run dev

<h2>🖥 Usage</h2>
Upload network logs or use sample data<br>
Model will process logs & generate predictions<br>
Visit dashboard → See threats, risk scores & map visualization<br>
Filter results by IP, threat type, or risk level

<h2>📈 Example Output</h2>

{<br>
"source_ip": "192.168.15.22",<br>
"dest_ip": "192.168.10.1",<br>
"protocol": "udp",<br>
"threat_score": 15,<br>
"threat_level": "Low",<br>
"reason": "The log shows a single DNS query (UDP port 53) from a local IP to another local IP. This is generally normal network activity.",<br>
"threat_type": "normal_traffic"<br>
}

<h2>🚀 Future Enhancements</h2>

📈 More explainable AI with SHAP/LIME<br>
🧠 Deep Learning models for advanced detection
